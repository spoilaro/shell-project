# Wish Shell

## Instructions

Building this shell requres the usage of CMake.
I chose to use cmake since it made it easy to write and run tests.
````
$ mkdir build // Creates a build directory
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..    // Generates a Makefile
$ make        // Does the actual building
$ ./wish      // Runs the shell
````

## Usage
There are a couple of built in commands like "exit" and "cd". "Exit" exits
the shell and "cd" changes the current directory.
